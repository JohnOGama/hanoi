        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
          The region around present-day Hanoi was settled in prehistoric times,
          and the location was often chosen as a political centre by Chinese
          conquerors. In 1010 Ly Thai To, the first ruler of the Ly dynasty
          (1009–1225) of Vietnam, chose the site of Hanoi—then called Thang Long
          (“Rising Dragon”)—for his capital. Thang Long remained the main
          capital of Vietnam until 1802, when the last Vietnamese dynasty, the
          Nguyen (1802–1945), transferred the capital south to Hue. The city
          occasionally was renamed for periods of time, and one of these names,
          Dong Kinh, given to it during the Later Le dynasty (1428–1787), became
          corrupted by Europeans to Tonquin. During the French colonial period
          (1883–1945) the name Tonkin was used to refer to the entire region. In
          1831 the city was renamed Ha Noi (“Between Two Rivers”) by the Nguyen
          dynasty.

        <h1>The contemporary city</h1>
        <p>
          Since 1954 Hanoi has been transformed from a primarily commercial city
          into an industrial and agricultural centre. Manufactures include
          machine tools, electric generators and motors, plywood, textiles,
          chemicals, and matches. Rice, fruits and vegetables, cereals, and
          industrial crops are grown in the surrounding area. Hanoi is also a
          communications centre. Roads link Hanoi with other major Vietnamese
          cities, and railway lines provide access to its port of Haiphong; to
          Kunming in Yunnan province, China; and to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon).
          Small oceangoing vessels can sail to Hanoi on the Red River, and many
          small rivers are navigable from the capital to most parts of northern
          Vietnam. Hanoi has two airports. Many of Hanoi’s centuries-old
          monuments and palaces have been destroyed by foreign aggression and
          civil war, but there remain several historical and scenic points.
          Among the latter is Lake Hoan Kiem (“Lake of the Restored Sword”).
          Historical sites include the Co Loa citadel, dating from the 3rd
          century BCE; the Temple of Literature (1070), dedicated to Confucius;
          the Mot Cot (“One-Pillar”) Pagoda (1049); and the Temple of the Trung
          Sisters (1142). In addition, the Central Sector of the Imperial
          Citadel of Thang Long, built in the 11th century, was designated in
          2010 as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The University of Hanoi, the
          Revolutionary Museum, the Army Museum, and the National Museum are
          important cultural institutions.
